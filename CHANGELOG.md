# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.11-alpha] - 2025-10-04

Changes to Claude Desktop and Claude Code have caused me to re-evalute
how I use the error flag in the ClojureMCP tool responses.

This change should make the tool results still legible/expandable when
there is a poorly executed tool call as opposed to a tool malfunction.

ClojureMCP tools has been mistakenly using the MCP tool result error
flag to signal errors that result from normal tool operation. Now only
runtime Exceptions will cause the MCP tool response to contain an
error flag of true.

### Fixed
- Prevent validation errors from sending MCP tool result error flag - validation/processing errors now appear in results without signaling protocol-level errors
- Fix truncation message showing file size in bytes instead of line count (#107)

## [0.1.10-alpha] - 2025-09-19

### Simplified nREPL Auto-Start ðŸš€

**Launching an nREPL server is now incredibly simple!** Just provide `:start-nrepl-cmd` and the MCP server handles everything else - perfect for Claude Code and other CLI-based AI tools.

#### Quick Start Examples

**From your project directory**, just run:

```bash
# For Leiningen projects
clojure -X:mcp :start-nrepl-cmd '["lein" "repl" ":headless"]'

# For deps.edn projects  
clojure -X:mcp :start-nrepl-cmd '["clojure" "-M:nrepl"]'

# For Babashka scripts
clojure -X:mcp :start-nrepl-cmd '["bb" "nrepl-server"]'
```

That's it! The MCP server will:
- Start your nREPL server automatically
- Discover the port from the output
- Connect and manage the process lifecycle
- Clean up when you're done

#### Perfect for Claude Code

This feature is especially valuable for **Claude Code** users who want to start coding immediately without managing separate terminal windows:

1. Open Claude Code in your Clojure project directory
2. The nREPL starts automatically when Claude connects
3. Start coding with full REPL support!

You can also configure this in `.clojure-mcp/config.edn`:
```edn
{:start-nrepl-cmd ["clojure" "-M:nrepl"]}
```

#### Note for Claude Desktop Users

**Important**: Claude Desktop does not start MCP servers from your project directory, so `:start-nrepl-cmd` will not work unless you also provide `:project-dir` pointing to your specific project:

```bash
# For Claude Desktop, you must specify the project directory:
clojure -X:mcp :start-nrepl-cmd '["lein" "repl" ":headless"]' :project-dir '"/path/to/your/clojure/project"'
```

This limitation does not affect Claude Code or other CLI-based tools that you run directly from your project directory.

#### Using a Fixed Port

If you prefer a specific port, just add it:
```bash
clojure -X:mcp :start-nrepl-cmd '["lein" "repl" ":headless"]' :port 7888
```

### Breaking Changes
- **Removed `:parse-nrepl-port`**: This confusing option has been eliminated. The MCP server now intelligently determines whether to parse the port based on whether `:port` is provided. Simple!

### Migration Note
If you were using `:parse-nrepl-port`, just remove it:
- Old: `:start-nrepl-cmd ["..."] :parse-nrepl-port true` 
- New: `:start-nrepl-cmd ["..."]`

## [0.1.9-alpha] - 2025-9-16

### Major Refactoring: Configuration-Based Agent Tools

* You can now define agents, prompts, and resources in the clojure-mcp config.edn file
* You can now have a user based ~/.clojure-mcp/config.edn file that will be merged into your project local config file.
* For Claude Code and other CLI based llm client users, clojure-mcp can now start your nrepl for you and pass off the dynamic port number to clojure-mcp.
* Let me repeat, **you can create sub-agents** in the clojure-mcp configuration [Configuring Agents](doc/configuring-agents.md). This coupled with being able to define LLM models allows a tremendous amount of flexibility in your tooling.

All this and much much more!

## [0.1.8-alpha] - 2025-08-13

### What's New

This release brings major configuration enhancements and improved
Clojure code editing.

In terms of Clojure editing, these improvements are significant. There
used to be some edit thrashing when editing functions with comments
that directly preceed them. This is now fixed. When the LLM wants to
replace a function along with its preceeding comments, clojure-mcp does
the right thing.

The sexp replacement has been revamped yet again. Sexpr replacement
will now succeed most of the time while being preceeding comment aware
as well.

The other big step forward is the addition of custom model
configuration in the `config.edn`. This is a direct result of
`langchain4j` improving its model support. Now you can define custom
model configurations to be used by the agent tools.

Other `.clojure-mcp/config.edn` configuration improvements allow you to 
* `:enable-tools` `:disable-tools`
* `:enable-prompts` `:disable-prompts`
* `:enable-resources` `:disable-resources`
* add tool specific configuration in `:tools-config`

With all these changes, I'm going to be removing the `-alpha` from the next release tag.

** Key Highlights:**
- **Custom LLM Models** - Define your own model configurations in `.clojure-mcp/config.edn` with environment variable support for API keys
- **Scittle Support** - Connect directly to Scittle nREPL without configuration - fun stuff!
- **Component Filtering** - Choose exactly which tools, prompts, and resources your server exposes
- **Improved Code Editing** - Much better handling of preceeding comments and sexp editing
- **Tool Configuration** - Configure individual tools with custom settings including model selection

**Example Model Configuration:**
```edn
:models {;; use the OpenAI client to connect to other models
         :openai/glm {:model-name "z-ai/glm-4.5"
                      :api-key [:env "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"]
                      :base-url [:env "OPENROUTER_BASE_URL"]
                      :temperature 1}
         :anthropic/my-claude {:model-name "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
                               :temperature 0.7}}

:tools-config {:dispatch_agent {:model :openai/my-fast}}
```

Currently these defined models are mainly used for the built-in agents, but if clojure-mcp had a cli that you could send prompts to...

**Documentation:**

These docs are incomplete but should get you started...

- Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini including setting the `:base-url` for the OpenAi client
- Built-in default models remain available when custom ones aren't defined

#### Tool-Specific Configuration System
New `:tools-config` key for configuring individual tools:
- **Per-tool settings**: Configure tools like `dispatch_agent`, `architect`, and `code_critique` with custom models
- **Example**: `:tools-config {:dispatch_agent {:model :openai/o3}}`

#### Component Filtering System
Fine-grained control over which components are enabled:
- **Tool filtering**: `:enable-tools` and `:disable-tools` configuration options
- **Prompt filtering**: `:enable-prompts` and `:disable-prompts` for controlling AI prompts

- **Tool call prefixing**: Added note about correctly prefixing tool calls to system prompt

## [0.1.7-alpha] - 2025-07-22

Note the major changes listed in `0.1.7-alpha-pre` below which are part of this release.

Moving out of pre-release with several code fixes. A new configuration option allows the dispatch_agent to load files as context. The `:dispatch-agent-context` setting accepts either:
- `true` - automatically loads `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` (if available) and `./.clojure-mcp/code_index.txt` (the new default output location for `clojure-mcp.code-indexer`)
- A vector of file paths - loads the specified files into the dispatch_agent context

This enables dispatch_agent to have better project awareness through pre-loaded context files.

### Fixed
- **Race condition in nREPL session creation** - Fixed critical race condition in `clojure-mcp.nrepl/new-session` that could cause session initialization failures
- **Working directory handling** - Shell commands now properly use the working directory when executing

### Added
- **:mcp-client-hint configuration** - New config option for providing hints to MCP clients about tool capabilities, used in scratch_pad tool schema - currently this allows me to experiment with using the more specific scratch_pad schema on claude desktop...
- **:dispatch-agent-context configuration** - New config option for providing context to dispatch agents 

### Changed
- **Updated to latest Clojure version** - Project now uses the most recent Clojure release
- **Code simplification** - Various internal simplifications to improve maintainability

### Documentation
- **Dual Shadow mode documentation** - Added documentation for dual Shadow CLJS mode setup
- **Minor grammar fixes** - Improved clarity in various documentation sections
- **Updated PROJECT_SUMMARY prompt** - Corrected command name in documentation

### Internal
- Fixed nREPL server function invocation
- Moved default code indexer output in preparation for dispatch-agent-content configuration
- Minor deps.edn configuration adjustments

### Contributors
Thanks to Jonathon McKitrick for documenting dual Shadow mode and Thomas Mattacchione for the PROJECT_SUMMARY prompt update.

## [v0.1.7-alpha-pre] - 2025-07-08

### Major Improvements

#### Performance Fix: Startup Speed
Fixed critical issue where ClojureMCP was scanning the home directory, causing extremely slow startup times. The fix includes:
- **Project inspection optimization**: Reduced from multiple glob calls to a single optimized call
- **Path validation**: Fixed bad paths being passed to glob functions that caused excessive filesystem scanning

#### Multi-Dialect Support
Initial support for non-JVM Clojure dialects including Babashka and Basilisp:
- **Reduced Initializing Clojure Evals**: Minimized reliance on Clojure code evaluation on startup
- **Multimethod dispatch**: Added `:nrepl-env-type` based dispatch for dialect-specific behavior
- **Configuration**: Use `:project-dir` command-line option to specify working directory for alternative dialects
- **Note**: Disable `:bash-over-nrepl` in `.clojure-mcp/config.edn` for non-JVM environments

#### Scratch Pad Persistence 
The scratch pad now automatically saves to `.clojure-mcp/scratch_pad.edn` on every change:
- **Explicit loading**: Use `scratch_pad_load` prompt to load saved data
- **Snapshot saving**: Use `scratch_pad_save_as` prompt to save snapshots to named files
- **Configurable filename**: Set `:scratch-pad-file` in config to use different filenames
- **Auto-load on startup**: Enable with `:scratch-pad-load true` in config
Many thanks to Mark Addleman for working on this.

  - `:nrepl-env-type` configuration parameter for dialect detection
  - Multimethod dispatch system for dialect-specific behavior
  - Support for Babashka, and Basilisp environments
- **Scratch pad persistence** with flexible configuration via `.clojure-mcp/config.edn`:
  - `:scratch-pad-load` boolean flag for auto-loading on startup (default: `false`)
  - `:scratch-pad-file` to specify filename within `.clojure-mcp/` directory (default: `"scratch_pad.edn"`)
  - Automatic saving on every change
- **New prompts for scratch pad file operations**:
  - `ACT/scratch_pad_load` prompt for loading EDN files into scratch pad
  - `ACT/scratch_pad_save_as` prompt for saving scratch pad snapshots to named files
- **Project directory override** with `:project-dir` command-line option
- **Pattern-based collapsed view for text files** in `read_file` tool:
  - Shows only lines matching patterns with 20 lines of context
  - Works with `content_pattern` or `name_pattern` parameters
- **Bash execution isolation**:
  - `:bash-over-nrepl` config option to control execution mode (default: `true`)
  - Separate nREPL session for bash commands to prevent REPL pollution
  - Output truncation for local bash execution
